                  This version (v0.1.8) introduces a complete visual overhaul of
                  the game and a more intuitive building process, all inspired
                  by a Cold War / WWII military command aesthetic. The new
                  interface is designed to be more immersive and thematic, with
                  a focus on providing a clear and concise overview of the game
                  state.

                  <li>
                    <strong>New, Intuitive Build Flow:</strong> The building
                    process has been reversed to be more user-friendly. You now
                    <strong
                      >first select the unit or structure you want to
                      build</strong
                    >
                    from the new build menu, and then you click on the map to
                    place it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Redesigned Control Panel:</strong> The main control
                    panel has been redesigned and now includes tabs for "Build",
                    "Attack", "Economy", and "Research", making it easier to
                    access all the game's features.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Integrated Build Menu:</strong> The build menu is
                    now part of the control panel, allowing for a more
                    streamlined building experience. It also includes a "Mass
                    Production" option for building multiple units.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Updated Unit Names:</strong> Several units have been
                    renamed to better fit the new theme (e.g., "City" is now
                    "Industrial Complex", "Warship" is now "Destroyer").
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Improved Visuals:</strong> The game now features new
                    background images.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                  This update aims to provide a more engaging, intuitive, and
                  visually appealing experience for all players.

                  This test version introduces a new mechanic:
                  <strong>Investment</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A new <strong>Investment Slider</strong> lets you dedicate a
                  portion of your nation's gold to productivity growth. Gold
                  spent on investment is subtracted before any other expenses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The more you invest, the faster your
                  <strong>worker productivity</strong> increasesâ€”boosting your
                  long-term gold income. Productivity grows gradually and
                  compounds over time, meaning consistent investment can lead to
                  a powerful economic advantage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nuclear strikes now <strong>reduce productivity</strong>
                  proportionally to the number of tiles you lose. This creates
                  longer-term economic damage beyond just troop and worker
                  losses.
