                <h1>Terratomic v0.1.10 – Release Notes</h1>
                <p>
                  We’re back with another quality update focused on UI
                  improvements, smoother gameplay interactions, and better
                  translations. This version tackles some long-standing
                  usability issues and adds helpful touches to make the game
                  more intuitive.
                </p>
                <h2>Gameplay & UI Fixes</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Fixed sticky map dragging:</strong> Dragging the map
                    will now properly stop when your cursor moves over UI
                    overlays, resolving the “endless drag” issue.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Improved build panel behavior:</strong> Fixed a race
                    condition where the build panel would immediately close if
                    you clicked too quickly after hovering. Navigation between
                    build options should now feel smooth and reliable.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Visual & Interaction Improvements</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Better cursor visibility in build mode:</strong> The
                    build-mode crosshair cursor has been changed from black to
                    white, making it far easier to spot against dark
                    territories.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Build menu hotkeys displayed:</strong> Each
                    buildable item now shows its configured hotkey directly in
                    the menu. No more guesswork—faster building at your
                    fingertips!
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Translation & Localization</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Corrected Airfield unit translation:</strong> The
                    Airfield unit now properly displays as “Airfield” instead of
                    a raw key value.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Consolidated alliance event translations:</strong>
                    Redundant and inconsistent alliance-related translations
                    have been streamlined for better clarity and consistency
                    across the UI.

                <h1>Release v0.1.9</h1>
                <p>
                  This release focuses on improving the user interface and user
                  experience, with a particular focus on the military theme and
                  hotkeys. We've also made some improvements to the build menu
                  and radial menu to make them more intuitive and easier to use.
                </p>
                <h2>What's New</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>UI Improvements to Radial and Build Menus:</strong>
                    The radial menu now closes automatically when you select an
                    item from the build menu, and the layout of the radial menu
                    has been corrected to be symmetrical when there are only
                    three items.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Build Hotkeys:</strong> You can now use hotkeys to
                    build units and structures, which should make it faster and
                    easier to build up your forces.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Military Theme Overhaul:</strong> The military theme
                    has been updated to be less bulky, with less padding, lower
                    heights, and a more opaque background. It also now fits
                    better on smaller screens.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Player Info Overlay:</strong> The Player Info
                    Overlay has been revamped and moved to better fit the new
                    military theme.
                  </li>

                <h1>Release v0.1.8</h1>
                <p>
                  This version (v0.1.8) introduces a complete visual overhaul of
                  the game and a more intuitive building process, all inspired
                  by a Cold War / WWII military command aesthetic. The new
                  interface is designed to be more immersive and thematic, with
                  a focus on providing a clear and concise overview of the game
                  state.
                </p>

                  <strong>Key Features:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>New, Intuitive Build Flow:</strong> The building
                    process has been reversed to be more user-friendly. You now
                    <strong
                      >first select the unit or structure you want to
                      build</strong
                    >
                    from the new build menu, and then you click on the map to
                    place it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Redesigned Control Panel:</strong> The main control
                    panel has been redesigned and now includes tabs for "Build",
                    "Attack", "Economy", and "Research", making it easier to
                    access all the game's features.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Integrated Build Menu:</strong> The build menu is
                    now part of the control panel, allowing for a more
                    streamlined building experience. It also includes a "Mass
                    Production" option for building multiple units.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Updated Unit Names:</strong> Several units have been
                    renamed to better fit the new theme (e.g., "City" is now
                    "Industrial Complex", "Warship" is now "Destroyer").
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Improved Visuals:</strong> The game now features new
                    background images.

                </ul>

                <p>
                  This test version introduces a new mechanic:
                  <strong>Investment</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A new <strong>Investment Slider</strong> lets you dedicate a
                  portion of your nation's gold to productivity growth. Gold
                  spent on investment is subtracted before any other expenses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The more you invest, the faster your
                  <strong>worker productivity</strong> increases—boosting your
                  long-term gold income. Productivity grows gradually and
                  compounds over time, meaning consistent investment can lead to
                  a powerful economic advantage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nuclear strikes now <strong>reduce productivity</strong>
                  proportionally to the number of tiles you lose. This creates
                  longer-term economic damage beyond just troop and worker
                  losses.
