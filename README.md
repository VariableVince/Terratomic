**Terratomic.io** is a large-scale Cold War strategy game featuring **nuclear warfare**, **naval and air combat**, and **economic expansion**. Players command nations through the global balance of power — managing **trade, production, alliances, and military escalation** in a tense race for dominance.

It is a fork of [OpenFront.io](https://github.com/openfrontio/OpenFrontIO), which itself was derived from [WarFront.io](https://github.com/WarFrontIO).

## 💬 Why This Fork

While OpenFront laid a strong foundation, Terratomic takes a different approach — placing community feedback and collaborative development at the core of its roadmap.

This project aims to evolve based on what players actually want, with transparent priorities and active community input shaping the game's future.

This is a game built _with_ its players, not just _for_ them.

## 🤝 Contributing

Whether you're here to squash bugs, prototype new mechanics, or improve the UI, here's how to get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1brucben/Terratomic.git
cd Terratomic
npm install
npm run dev
```

> **Note for Windows users:** If you encounter map loading errors like "invalid data, buffer size incorrect", run `git add --renormalize .` and then `git checkout -- .` to fix binary file line-ending issues.

You're now ready to start developing locally. A formal contribution guide will be published soon.

Until then, open issues, submit pull requests, or join the discussion [on Discord](https://discord.gg/JNZbp4pg5y) — we're listening.
